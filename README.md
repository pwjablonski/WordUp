## Tech
Word Up uses [**React**](https://facebook.github.io/react/) to render views,
[**Redux**](http://redux.js.org/) to manage application state,
[**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/) for data persistence, authentication and hosting.

### Architecture Overview
User interaction lifecycle:

- User interactions are first captured by handlers in React
  [components](https://github.com/pwjablonski/word-up/tree/master/src/components).
- The component dispatches one or more Redux
  [actions](https://github.com/pwjablonski/word-up/tree/master/src/actions).
- Dispatched actions are consumed by the
  [reducers](https://github.com/pwjablonski/word-up/tree/master/src/reducers),
  which update the
  [store](https://github.com/pwjablonski/word-up/blob/master/src/store.js).
- Asynchronus proccesing such as requests to the database are handled by [logics](https://github.com/pwjablonski/word-up/blob/master/src/logic)
- When the action lifecycle is complete, the components receive updated
  data via [selectors](https://github.com/pwjablonski/word-up/blob/master/src/selectors) and render accordingly
